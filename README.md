# ùöäùöãùöûùöïùöäùöèùöíùöä: A tool for fair and reproducible crowdsourcing

ùöäùöãùöûùöïùöäùöèùöíùöä is a tool for creating and deploying tasks on the the [Toloka](https://toloka.ai) crowdsourcing platform. 

The tool allows you to create crowdsourcing tasks using pre-defined task interfaces and configuring their settings using [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) files.

For a description of the tool and the motivation for its development, see this [publication](https://aclanthology.org/2022.latechclfl-1.2/).

Paid crowdsourcing is widely used in natural language processing and computer vision, but has been rarely applied in the digital humanities due to ethical concerns. We discuss concerns associated with paid crowdsourcing and describe how we seek to mitigate them in designing the tool and crowdsourcing pipelines. We demonstrate how the tool may be used to create annotations for diagrams, a complex mode of expression whose description requires human input.",

## Installation

You can install the tool from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/abulafia/) using the following command: `pip install abulafia`

Alternatively, you can clone this repository and install the tool locally. Move to the directory that contains the repository and type: `pip install .`

## Key concepts

ùöäùöãùöûùöïùöäùöèùöíùöä defines three basic components for building crowdsourcing pipelines: tasks, actions and task sequences. 

In [Toloka terms](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/glossary.html), tasks are equal to projects, whereas task sequences consist of projects that are connected to each other. Actions, in turn, operate on the input/output data of projects.

### Tasks

Each crowdsourcing task is specified and configured using a YAML file. Each configuration file should include the following keys: 

- `name` of the task
- the types of `input` and `output` data under key `data`
- `actions`, if applicable
- `interface` settings
- `project` settings
- `pool` settings

Optionally, you can add `quality_control` settings. Options for quality control are the following:

- [Fast responses](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/concepts/quick-answers.html)
- [Skipped assignments](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/concepts/skipped-assignments.html)
- Re-do assignments from banned users
- [Captcha](https://toloka.ai/docs/guide/concepts/captcha.html)
- [Golden set](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.collectors.GoldenSet) (performance on control tasks)

See the directory [`examples/config`](https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia/tree/main/examples/config) for examples of YAML configuration files.

**Blocklist:** If you want to prevent some users from having access to a specific pool, add the key `blocklist` under `pool` configuration and give a path to a TSV file containing the column `user_id` with user identifiers of the workers you would like to block (see the example in [`examples/config/detect_text.yaml`](https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia/blob/main/examples/config/detect_text.yaml)). 

### Actions

Just like crowdsourcing tasks, each action requires its own YAML configuration file. [`examples/action_demo.py`](https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia/blob/main/examples/action_demo.py) defines a pipeline that uses the `Aggregate`, `Forward` and `SeparateBBoxes` actions.

**Forward** action requires the following keys:

- `name` of the action
- `data` 
- `source`, the pool where the tasks to be forwarded originate

Variable names for the possible outputs for the source task and pools to which they should be forwarded are configured under the key `on_result` under `actions`. 

You can either configure a pool to which to forward, or use the keywords `accept` or `reject` to automatically accept or reject tasks based on the output. These keywords are meant to be used for tasks that involve workers verifying work submitte by other workers. 

For example, you can ask workers to determine if an image has been annotated correctly. You can then use aggregation and forwarding to automatically accept or reject the *original* task by using key-value pairs such as `correct: accept` and `incorrect: reject` in your `Forward` configuration. You can also configure both accepting/rejecting and forwarding to another pool. In that case, use a list as the value for the variable name of the output. See the file [`examples/action_demo.py`](https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia/blob/main/examples/action_demo.py) and the associated YAML configuration files for an example. 

Configure `Forward` actions to the source pool/action under `actions` with the key `on_result`.

**Aggregate** action requires the keys:

- `name` of the action
- `source`, the pool from which tasks go to the aggregate action
- The forward action to which the aggregated results will be sent should be configured under key `on_result` under `actions`
- `method`, which is the desired [aggregation algorithm](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/crowd-kit/). For now, categorical methods are supported.

Configure `Aggregate` actions to the source pool under `actions` with the key `on_closed`; aggregation can only be done after all tasks are complete and the pool is closed.

**SeparateBBoxes** action requires the keys:

- `name` of the action
- The type of data that the action produces should be configured under the key `output` under `data`

If you wish to start your pipeline with `SeparateBBoxes`, configure it under `actions` as value for the key `data_source` in the following pool. Then, the action reads a TSV file with images and bounding boxes and separates the bounding boxes to one per task. Note that the bounding boxes must be in the format that Toloka uses. If you want to have the action in the middle of a pipeline, you can configure it in your `Forward` action under one of the possible outputs of your task (for example; if you want all tasks with the output `True` to be forwarded to `SeparateBBoxes`, configure `True: name_of_your_separatebboxes_action` under `on_result` under `actions`. See `config/forward_verify.yaml` for an example). If you want, you can add a label for the bounding boxes in the resulting tasks, by giving the label as a value for the parameter `add_label`. Labelled bounding boxes are used in, for example, `AddOutlines` and `LabelledSegmentationVerification` tasks.

### Task sequences

Task sequences are pipelines can consist of crowdsourcing tasks as well as actions that perform operations before, between or after tasks. The `Forward` action is used to transfer tasks from one pool to another based on task output. The `Aggregate` action is used to aggregate the output of a task; the action uses your aggregation algorithm of choice to determine the most probable output to a task. `SeparateBBoxes` is an action that takes an image with several bounding boxes, separates the bounding boxes to one per image, and creates new tasks from those.

If you wish to move tasks from one pool to another based on the acceptance status of the task, not the task output, you can configure the receiving pool under `actions` with keys `on_submitted`, `on_accepted` or `on_rejected`. For example, if you wish rejected work to go back to the pool to be re-completed by another worker, you can configure the current pool as value to the key `on_rejected`.

To deploy your crowdsourcing tasks to Toloka, the tool needs to read your credentials from a JSON file e.g. `creds.json`. Remember to never add this file to public version control. The contents of the file should be the following:

```
{
    "token": "YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN",
    "mode": "SANDBOX"
}
```

When you've tested your pipeline in the Toloka sandbox, change the value for `"mode"` from `"SANDBOX"` to `"PRODUCTION"`.

See the directory [`examples/`](https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia/tree/main/examples) for examples of crowdsourcing pipelines.

The screenshot below shows an example of running the tool.

## Ensuring fair payments

The tool has a built-in mechanism that guides the user to determine rewards that result in a fair hourly wage ($12) for the crowdsourced workers. In the pool configuration, the user should add a key `estimated_time_per_suite`. The value for the key should be the estimated time in seconds it takes for the worker to complete one task suite. Based on this value and the value `reward_per_assignment`, the tool checks if the reward is high enough to result in a fair hourly wage. The user is presented with a warning and prompted to cancel the pipeline if the configured reward is too low. A warning is also raised if `estimated_time_per_suite` is not found in the pool configuration.

To calculate a fair reward per task suite, you can use the interactive script `utils/calculate_fair_rewards.py`.

## Pre-defined interfaces

Define crowdsourcing tasks in a Python file by creating one or many of the task objects listed below. They all take arguments `configuration`, which is the path to the correct YAML configuration file, and `client`, which should be your Toloka client.

You can define additional task interfaces by inheriting the [`CrowdsourcingTask`](https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia/blob/main/src/abulafia/task_specs/core_task.py) class. The currently implemented task interfaces can be found in [`src/abulafia/task_specs/task_specs.py`](https://github.com/thiippal/abulafia/tree/main/src/abulafia/task_specs). These task interfaces are described in greater detail below.
